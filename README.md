## 1. Initialization
After downloading the project run
```
npm init
npm postinstall
```

`npm postinstall` is used to provide aliases for some pathes.
> Notice!
> `npm postinstall` adds `@plugins, @blocks and @frontend` directories to node_modules, that must be removed before running `npm install`. Otherwise it might lead to losing files from mentioned directories.

## 3. Architecture

### this.state
All js objects extend `Component` class.
The main idea behind it was to bind data between different modules.
To achieve it each instance of `Component` has `this.state` variable.
For example for `LikeButton` we have the following state:

```js
class LikeButton {
  state = {
    liked: {
      value: true,
      alias: "likeButtonPressed",
      isGlobal: true,
      subscribers: [
        this.someFunction.bind(this)
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
```js
class Feedback {
  state = {
    likeButtonPressed: {
      value: true,
      subscribers: [
        this.someOtherFunction
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example `LikeButton` has one variable that it dependends on: `liked`. 
To interact with it use `this.liked`, not `this.state.liked`.

`alias` means what name will the parent class work with. In this case for `LikeButton` class it will be `this.liked` and for 
parent class - `this.likeButtonPressed`.

`isGlobal` means that this variable will copy the parents state, according with the name or alias.

`subscribers` will be run after any implementation:
```js
this.liked = true;
```

> Basically `likeButton.liked` and `feedback.likedButtonPressed` are refering to the same object.
> And in case of any implementation `this.liked = true` or `this.likedButtonPressed = true` 
> both `someFunction` and `someOtherFunction` will be called.


### this.children
All children classes are supposed to be added to `this.children` to keep data binding.
Otherwise `states` won`t be connected.


### clickHandler()
`Component` also has events delegating.
Any component that does not have parent will add eventListener to itself. And depending on what part of it`s body was clicked - 
will delegate this event to children by calling their `clickHandler()`.


### this.closers
`this.closers` contains functions that will be called when click event happend out of the element.
